## 🚀 Features
- Predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
- Uses advanced machine learning techniques for high accuracy.
- Provides insights for early cancer detection and diagnosis.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains clinical features and a diagnosis column:
  - **Features**: Attributes related to tumor characteristics.
  - **Target**: Diagnosis (1 = Malignant, 0 = Benign).
- Dataset was preprocessed to train and test the model effectively.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Dataset splitting and utilities.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Model creation and training.
